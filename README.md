This is a simple project to show my understanding of HTML and some of the most commonly used tags.
The project will consist of a couple pages of recipes found on allrecipes.com
By the end of the project, I aim to display my understanding of HTML boilerplate, header tags, paragraph tags, ordered and unorded lists, links, and image tags.
